             Subtitle A--Confidential Information Protection

SEC. 511. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 44 USC 3501 note.&gt;&gt; FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Individuals, businesses, and other organizations have=20
        varying degrees of legal protection when providing information=20
        to the agencies for strictly statistical purposes.
            (2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide=20
        assurances to the public that information about individuals or=20
        organizations or provided by individuals or organizations for=20
        exclusively statistical purposes will be held in confidence and=20
        will not be used against such individuals or organizations in=20
        any agency action.
            (3) Protecting the confidentiality interests of individuals=20
        or organizations who provide information under a pledge of=20
        confidentiality for Federal statistical programs serves both the=20
        interests of the public and the needs of society.
            (4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of=20
        information provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the=20
        agencies adversely affects both the accuracy and completeness of=20
        statistical analyses.
            (5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge of=20
        confidentiality for statistical purposes receives protection is=20
        essential in continuing public cooperation in statistical=20
        programs.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are the following:
            (1) To ensure that information supplied by individuals or=20
        organizations to an agency for statistical purposes under a=20
        pledge of confidentiality is used exclusively for statistical=20
        purposes.
            (2) To ensure that individuals or organizations who supply=20
        information under a pledge of confidentiality to agencies for=20
        statistical purposes will neither have that information=20
        disclosed

[[Page 116 STAT. 2966]]

        in identifiable form to anyone not authorized by this title nor=20
        have that information used for any purpose other than a=20
        statistical purpose.
            (3) To safeguard the confidentiality of individually=20
        identifiable information acquired under a pledge of=20
        confidentiality for statistical purposes by controlling access=20
        to, and uses made of, such information.

SEC. 512. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 44 USC 3501 note.&gt;&gt; LIMITATIONS ON USE AND DI=
SCLOSURE=20
            OF DATA AND INFORMATION.

    (a) Use of Statistical Data or Information.--Data or information=20
acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality and for=20
exclusively statistical purposes shall be used by officers, employees,=20
or agents of the agency exclusively for statistical purposes.
    (b) Disclosure of Statistical Data or Information.--
            (1) Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge=20
        of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall=20
        not be disclosed by an agency in identifiable form, for any use=20
        other than an exclusively statistical purpose, except with the=20
        informed consent of the respondent.
            (2) A disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1) is authorized=20
        only when the head of the agency approves such disclosure and=20
        the disclosure is not prohibited by any other law.
            (3) This section does not restrict or diminish any=20
        confidentiality protections in law that otherwise apply to data=20
        or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of=20
        confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes.

    (c) Rule for Use of Data or Information for Nonstatistical=20
Purposes.--A statistical agency or unit shall clearly distinguish any=20
data or information it collects for nonstatistical purposes (as=20
authorized by law) and provide notice to the public, before the data or=20
information is collected, that the data or information could be used for=20
nonstatistical purposes.
    (d) Designation of Agents.--A statistical agency or unit may=20
designate agents, by contract or by entering into a special agreement=20
containing the provisions required under section 502(2) for treatment as=20
an agent under that section, who may perform exclusively statistical=20
activities, subject to the limitations and penalties described in this=20
title.

SEC. 513. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 44 USC 3501 note.&gt;&gt; FINES AND PENALTIES.

information for exclusively statistical purposes, having taken and=20
subscribed the oath of office, or having sworn to observe the=20
limitations imposed by section 512, comes into possession of such=20
information by reason of his or her being an officer, employee, or agent=20
and, knowing that the disclosure of the specific information is=20
prohibited under the provisions of this title, willfully discloses the=20
information in any manner to a person or agency not entitled to receive=20

                   Subtitle B--Statistical Efficiency

SEC. 521. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 44 USC 3501 note.&gt;&gt; FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Federal statistics are an important source of=20
        information for public and private decision-makers such as=20
        policymakers, consumers, businesses, investors, and workers.
            (2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to=20
        improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the=20
        ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve=20
        higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.
            (3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the=20
        willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys.=20
        Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and=20
        therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the=20
        economy.
            (4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of=20
        the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of=20
        Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will=20
        improve their ability to track more accurately the large and=20
        rapidly changing nature of United States business. In=20
        particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better=20
        ensure that businesses are consistently classified in=20
        appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce=20
        statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry=20
        and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct=20
        faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.
            (5) The Congress enacted the International Investment and=20
        Trade in Services Act of 1990 that allowed the Bureau of the=20
        Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor=20
        Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not=20
        only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to=20
        over 800 industries with no increase in the data collected from=20
        respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in=20
        the creation of valuable data products.
            (6) With subtitle A of this title, the sharing of business=20
