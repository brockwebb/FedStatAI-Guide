                    <P>
                        The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues a request for public comments on a proposal to modify one provision within 
                        <E T="03">Statistical Policy Directive No. 3: Compilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators</E>
                         (Directive No. 3). The procedures in Directive No. 3, published in 1985, were designed to ensure equitable, policy-neutral, and timely release and dissemination of Principal Federal Economic Indicators (PFEIs). The goals of Directive No. 3 remain sound; this Notice proposes updates to procedures consistent with these goals to reflect advances in communication technologies and methods. In particular, OMB proposes to modify the provision, “employees of the Executive Branch shall not comment publicly on the data until at least one hour after the official release time,” by replacing “one hour” with “thirty minutes.” This proposed change would reduce the delay after official release time before commentary from employees of the Executive Branch. Additional discussion of the request for public comment may be found in the

                     The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues a request for comments on a proposal to change one provision within 
                    <E T="03">Statistical Policy Directive No. 3: Compilation, Release, and Evaluation of Principal Federal Economic Indicators</E>
                     (50 FR 38932, Sep. 25, 1985) (Directive No. 3), issued under the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 (31 U.S.C. 1104(d)) and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3504(e)) (the PRA).

                    <FTREF/>
                     The stated purposes of Directive No. 3 are to preserve the time value of the economic indicators, strike a balance between timeliness and accuracy, provide for periodic evaluation of each indicator, prevent early access to information that may affect financial and commodity markets, and preserve the distinction between the policy-neutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials. Directive No. 3 remains a robust, comprehensive source of guidance for Federal statistical agencies and recognized statistical units producing Principal Federal Economic Indicators (PFEIs). The government and private sector widely watch and heavily rely upon these statistical series as indicators of the current condition and direction of the economy.

                    The procedures in Directive No. 3, published in 1985, were designed to ensure equitable, policy-neutral, and timely release and dissemination of Principal Federal Economic Indicators (“PFEIs”). The goals of Directive No. 3 remain sound, and this Notice does not seek to change them. Specifically, in furtherance of these goals, we are proposing to retain the requirement that some period of time needs to elapse between the policy-neutral release of the data and the public interpretation of such data by policy officials in the Executive Branch. More background and history on the policies of Directive No. 3 can be found in the April 2019

                    <E T="03">Previous proposal.</E>
                     In April 2019, OMB published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     a request for comments on a proposal to reduce the duration of the prohibition of commentary by employees of the Executive Branch following the PFEI release from one hour to something shorter, including the consideration of the option of having no delay at all (84 FR 14682, Apr. 11, 2019). OMB received sixteen in-scope comments in response to that Notice.
                    <SU>2</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     All in-scope commenters strongly supported either a retention of the one-hour delay, or a delay of some duration, after official release time before employees of the Executive Branch could comment on the PFEI releases, with no commenters in support of removing the delay entirely.
                </P>

                    <P>

                    <E T="03">Updated proposal.</E>
                     OMB agrees with the previous comments on this issue submitted in 2019, and understands that maintaining some delay as part of Directive No. 3 continues to be important to maintain the bright line between the release of data and any commentary on such data by Executive Branch officials. OMB is seeking public comment on the updated proposal that would modify the delay from one hour to thirty minutes. OMB is considering this updated proposal because, while the delay is important to ensuring a clear bright line between the data release and the Executive Branch's policy interpretation, OMB also understands that since 1985 there have been many changes in the way we communicate within and across society, as well as in how the relevant agencies disseminate information. For example, in addition to more traditional means of dissemination (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     newspaper or radio), agencies now disseminate and society interacts with data releases through the internet, including through websites, social media platforms, and other applications. These newer dissemination platforms in particular offer nearly instantaneous access to any information supplied by the agencies producing the PFEI data, including the data releases. These platforms can also offer direct attribution of the data to the agencies that produce it; these agencies are required to meet data quality standards and are trusted to implement those requirements. These advances in the timing and attribution of dissemination can contribute to the ability of society to fully digest the data releases sooner than when such dissemination methods were not available.
                </P>
                <P>In addition, society generally communicates and interacts differently now than in 1985. In particular, various platforms exist now that allow society to interact seconds after a new data release comes out. This means that for these PFEI data releases, non-governmental actors are engaging in dialogue almost immediately following the official release time and can be offering perspectives on the meaning of the data. Under the current Directive No. 3, this dialogue is missing any Executive Branch interpretation until at least one hour after the data's official release time. Under this proposal to reduce the delay to thirty minutes, Executive Branch officials could enter the dialogue thirty minutes earlier. OMB is considering the proposed change because we believe it is likely to lead to a more robust discussion without compromising the underlying principles of Directive No. 3, including the benefits of having some time delay.</P>
                <P>
                    OMB is not considering any other alternatives in this proposal; this means that OMB is neither considering removing the delay entirely, nor is it considering any other changes to any other policies in Directive No. 3. OMB proposes changing the italicized text in the excerpt from Directive No. 3 below, which is part of the last paragraph of Section 5 of Directive No. 3

                     OMB seeks comments from all interested parties, including data users, businesses, organizations, and the media. Specifically, OMB seeks comments from the public about the proposal to change the delay from one hour to thirty minutes, including whether such a change could still meet the goals of Directive No. 3 to ensure equitable, policy-neutral, and timely release and dissemination of PFEIs. OMB also seeks input on whether to maintain the one-hour delay.
